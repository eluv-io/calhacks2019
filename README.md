Eluvio API Challenge

Eluvio is creating a revolutionary approach for distributing and monetizing video content over the Internet, based on content-centric and decentralized design. The Eluvio Content Fabric is a global software overlay network that allows Content providers to distribute premium video globally including on demand video, live streams, and hybrid (linear, live and on demand) video experiences, direct to viewers without CDNs, aggregators, or transcoding services. The viewer experience is "instant on" low latency and high quality. 

Blockchain contracts back every content object (media asset) in the Content Fabric and all content objects have programmable "code", so new opportunities for monetizing media, achieving personalization, and creating new interactive / gamified experiences is possible, and rights control can be built in.

At CalHacks 6.0 Eluvio is sponsoring a challenge to use our elv-client APIs (see here on https://github.com/eluv-io) to create new applications and experiences that take advantage of the platform's unique capabilities to publish and globally stream and monetize audio/video content.  

To see our platform in action and an example use of our API, visit https://eluv.io/stream-sample

To see our API introduction, visit https://eluvi.io/dev

In using the APIs, you will be using blockchain contracts and the core content fabric APIs to organize and manage media assets and metadata, and you will learn the principles of adaptive bit rate video streaming and video player integration.
