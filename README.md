# SXSW2019

# Eluvio API Challenge #

Eluvio is creating a revolutionary approach for distributing and monetizing video content over the Internet, based on content-centric and decentralized design.

The Eluvio Content Fabric is a global software overlay network that allows content providers to distribute premium video including on demand video, live streams, and hybrid experiences, direct to viewers without CDNs, aggregators, or transcoding services. The viewer experience is "instant on" low latency and high quality.

Blockchain contracts back every content object (media asset) in the Content Fabric and all content objects have programmable "code", so new opportunities for monetizing media, achieving personalization, and creating new interactive / gamified experiences is possible, and rights control can be built in.

## At SXSW 2020 Eluvio is sponsoring a challenge to use our `elv-client` APIs ##
Use [`elv-client-js`](https://github.com/eluv-io/elv-client-js) to create new applications and experiences that take advantage of the platform's unique capabilities to publish and globally stream and monetize audio/video content.

## What Technologies will you learn? ##
- blockchain contracts
- blockchain wallet authentication
- the core content fabric APIs to organize and manage media assets and metadata (Javascript/JSON RPC/REST)
- principles of low latency, secure adaptive bit rate video streaming
- video player integration.
